## Description
WeServe is a call service agency that outsources customer service personnels to several companies.
These agents are located in one call center. They receive calls from customers, and make calls to customers, in order to listen to complaints, and get feedback of products and services they have purchased from varying companies.
These calls are recorded in the call log sheet, with some extra details saved in the
call details sheet.
The customer service managers would
like to understand the activities of these
call agents better.
This requires the:
- cleaning of the dataset into a structure suitable for a data warehouse, and for
analysis as some columns have some omissions and errors.
- Create aggregates, among your facts and dim schemas, that will help with KPI
measurements about the business.
- Document your entire process

## Language and tools
- Python
- Pandas

## Steps
